                Milkha Singh (20 November 1929 â€“ 18 June 2021), also known 
                as The Flying Sikh, was an Indian track and field sprinter
                who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian
                Army. He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the
                Asian Games as well as the Commonwealth Games. He also won
                gold medals in the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games. 
                He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, 
                the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics 
                in Tokyo. He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest 
                civilian honour, in recognition of his sporting achievements.
                <br><br>
                The race for which Singh was best remembered is his fourth-place
                finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games, which 
                he had entered as one of the favourites. He led the race till the 
                200m mark before easing off, allowing others to pass him. 
                Various records were broken in the race, which required a photo-finish 
                and saw American Otis Davis being declared the winner by one-hundredth 
                of a second over German Carl Kaufmann. Singh's fourth-place 
                time of 45.73 seconds was the Indian national record for almost 40 years.
                <br><br>
                From beginnings that saw him orphaned and displaced during the 
                Partition of India, Singh has become a sporting icon in his country. 
                In 2008, journalist Rohit Brijnath described Singh as 
                "the finest athlete India has ever produced".
                <br><br>
                Singh died of COVID-19 complications on 18 June 2021 at the age of 91

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Milkha Singh was born on 20 November 1929. He was born in a Sikh family 
                of Rathore Rajput origin. His birthplace was Govindpura, a village 
                10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab Province, 
                British India (now Muzaffargarh District, Pakistan). He was one of 
                15 siblings, eight of whom died before the Partition of India. 
                He was orphaned during the Partition when his parents, a brother and 
                two sisters were killed in the violence that ensued. 
                He witnessed these killings.
                <br><br>        
                Escaping the troubles in Punjab, where killings of Hindus and Sikhs 
                were continuing,by moving to Delhi, India, in 1947, Singh lived for 
                a short time with the family of his married sister and was briefly 
                imprisoned at Tihar jail for travelling on a train without a ticket. 
                His sister, Ishvar, sold some jewellery to obtain his release. 
                He spent some time at a refugee camp in Purana Qila and at a 
                resettlement colony in Shahdara, both in Delhi.
                <br><br>
                Singh became disenchanted with his life and considered becoming a 
                dacoit but was instead persuaded by one of his brothers, 
                Malkhan, to attempt recruitment to the Indian Army. 
                He successfully gained entrance on his fourth attempt, in 1951, 
                and while stationed at the Electrical Mechanical Engineering Centre 
                in Secunderabad he was introduced to athletics. He had run the 10 km 
                distance to and from school as a child and was selected by the army 
                for special training in athletics after finishing sixth in a compulsory 
                cross-country run for new recruits. Singh has acknowledged how the army 
                introduced him to sport, saying that "I came from a remote village, 
                I didn't know what running was, or the Olympics"

        <h2>International Career</h2>
        <p>
            Singh represented India in the 200m and 400m competitions of the 
            1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. His inexperience meant that he did not 
            progress from the heat stages but a meeting with the eventual 400m 
            champion at those Games, Charles Jenkins, both inspired him to greater 
            things and provided him with information about training methods.
            <br><br>
            In 1958, Singh set records for the 200m and 400m in the National Games 
            of India, held at Cuttack,and also won gold medals in the same events 
            at the Asian Games. He then won a gold medal in the 400m (440 yards at this time) 
            competition at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games with a time of 
            46.6 seconds.This latter achievement made him the first gold medalist at the 
            Commonwealth Games from independent India.Before Vikas Gowda won the gold in 2014, 
            Milkha was the only Indian male to have won an individual athletics gold medal 
            at those Games.
            <br><br>
            Singh was persuaded by Jawaharlal Nehru to set aside his memories of the Partition 
            era to race successfully in 1960 against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan, where a post-race 
            comment by the then General Ayub Khan led to him acquiring the nickname of The Flying Sikh. 
            Some sources say that he set a world record of 45.8 seconds in France, shortly 
            before the Rome Olympics in the same year but the official report of the Games lists 
            the record holder as Lou Jones, who ran 45.2 at Los Angeles in 1956.At those Olympics,
            he was involved in a close-run final race in the 400m competition, where he 
            was placed fourth. Singh had beaten all the leading contenders other than 
            Otis Davis, and a medal had been anticipated because of his good form. 
            However, he made an error when leading the race at 250m, slowing down in the belief 
            that his pace could not be sustained and looking round at his fellow competitors. 
            Singh believes that these errors caused him to lose his medal opportunity and they 
            are his "worst memory".[10] Davis, Carl Kaufmann and Malcolm Spence all passed him, 
            and a photo-finish resulted. Davis and Kaufman were both timed at a world-record 
            breaking 44.9 seconds, while Spence and Singh went under the pre-Games Olympic record 
            of 45.9 seconds, set in 1952 by George Rhoden and Herb McKenley, with times of 45.5 and 
            45.6 seconds, respectively. The Age noted in 2006 that "Milkha Singh is the only Indian 
            to have broken an Olympic track record. Unfortunately he was the fourth man to do so in 
            the same race" but the official Olympic report notes that Davis had already equalled the 
            Rhoden/McKenley Olympic record in the quarter-finals and surpassed it with a time of 45.5 
            seconds in the semi-finals.
            <br><br>
           At the 1962 Asian Games, held in Jakarta, Singh won gold in the 400m and in the 
           4 x 400m relay.He attended the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he was entered to 
           compete in the 400m, the 4 x 100m relay and the 4 x 400m relay. He did not take part 
           in either the 400m or the 4 x 100m relay and the Indian team of Milkha Singh, Makhan Singh, 
           Amrit Pal and Ajmer Singh were eliminated when they finished fourth in the heat stages of 
           the 4 x 400m.
          <br><br>
          There have been claims that Singh won 77 of his 80 races, but these are spurious. 
          The number of races in which he participated is not verified, nor is the number of victories, 
          but he lost a 400m race at the 1964 National Games in Calcutta to Makhan Singh and he did 
          not finish first in any of his four races at the 1960 Olympic Games or the aforementioned 
          qualification races at the 1956 Olympics.
          Singh's time in the 1960 Olympics 400m final, which was run on a cinder track, 
          set a national record that stood until 1998 when Paramjit Singh exceeded it on a 
          synthetic track and with fully automatic timing that recorded 45.70 seconds. Although Singh's 
          Olympic result of 45.6 seconds had been hand-timed, an electronic system at those Games had 
          determined his record to be 45.73.

         <h2>Later Life</h2>
         <p>Singh was promoted from the rank of sepoy to junior commissioned officer 
             in recognition of his successes in the 1958 Asian Games. He subsequently 
             became Director of Sports in Punjab Ministry of Education, a post he retired from 
             in 1998.
             Singh was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian award, following 
             his success in 1958. In 2001, he turned down an offer of the Arjuna Award from the 
             Indian government, arguing that it was intended to recognise young sports people and 
             not those such as him. He also thought that the Award was being inappropriately given to 
             people who had little notable involvement as active sports people at all. He said that 
             "I have been clubbed with sportspersons who are nowhere near the level that I had achieved" 
             and that the award had become devalued. While sharing his experience in a college in Goa 
             in 2014, he stated, "The awards nowadays are distributed like 'prasad' in a temple. 
             Why should one be honoured when he or she has not achieved the benchmark for the award? 
             I rejected the Arjuna I was offered after I received the Padma Shri. It was like being 
             offered an SSC [secondary school] certificate after securing a Masters degree."
             <br><br>
             All of Singh's medals have been donated to the nation. They were displayed at the 
             Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi and later moved to a sports museum in Patiala, where 
             a pair of running shoes that he wore in Rome are also displayed. In 2012, he donated the 
             Adidas shoes that he had worn in the 1960 400m final to be sold in a charity auction 
             organised by actor Rahul Bose.
             <br><br>
             Singh was admitted to the intensive care unit at Fortis Hospital in Mohali on 
             24 May 2021 with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. His condition was, for a while, described 
             as stable, but he died on 18 June 2021 at 11:30 pm in Chandigarh. His wife, Nirmal Saini, 
             had died a few days earlier on 13 June 2021, also due to COVID-19. Singh was laid on his 
             funeral pyre with a photo of his wife in his hands.

     <div>    
         <h2>Media and popular culture</h2>
         <p>
             Singh and his daughter, Sonia Sanwalka, co-wrote his autobiography, titled 
             The Race of My Life. It was published in 2013. The book inspired Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, 
             a 2013 biographical film of Singh's life.The film is directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, 
             and stars Farhan Akhtar in the lead role, with Divya Dutta and Sonam Kapoor in pivotal roles. 
             The film was widely acclaimed in India and won awards including the National Film Award 
             for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the National Film Awards,and 
             5 awards at the International Indian Film Academy Awards in 2014. The film made over 
             â‚¹100 crores. Singh sold the movie rights for one rupee but inserted a clause stating 
             that a share of the profits would be given to the Milkha Singh Charitable Trust. 
             The Trust was founded in 2003 with the aim of assisting poor and needy sportspeople.
             <br><br>
             In September 2017, Singh's wax statue â€“ created by sculptors of Madame Tussauds in 
             London â€“ was unveiled at Chandigarh. It depicts Singh in running posture during his 
             victorious run at the 1958 Commonwealth Games.[40] The statue is placed at Madame Tussauds 
             museum in New Delhi, India
